# MyRPG RotMG Version
Use this source code do make your own working RotMG server! Here your will find the Server source and the Client source.

## About server source:
This project is based on FSoD (https://github.com/ossimc82/fabiano-swagger-of-doom).

I didn't developed this server source, just modified few things to make game like what I planned to be.

## How to use WebClient

- Inside "/server/game", are the files for run the WebClient.
- Inside "/server/php", are the files for enable the WebClient.
- So, edit files in "/server/game" and run PhP(/server/php). Done!

- Delete the "AssembleeGameClient201409192100" and paste your own client, and edit "version.txt" for put the name of your client!
- If your have an Testing Client, edit "testingVersion.txt" for put the name of your client, and paste the client in the folder!
